      "When I started working with you Adriana was rated 1798 for US chess and had no FIDE rating. I hadn't played tournaments in a few years, and I hoped to get to 2000 US eventually. But now I'm over 2100 US! National Master starts at 2200 US, and I hope to get there in the next year or so. Adriana's lessons have helped me so much, I have never had any idea what to do in the opening, and really only relied on tactics. Now while my tactics still need work, I feel like a more 'complete' player.",

      "Over the past three months, I have the opportunity to hire Adriana like a coach for my son Daniel. During this period, Danielâ€™s chess skill has improved significantly. His tactics rating on Chess.com has improved over 700 points from 1400 to 2112, which is a remarkable achievement for a third grade kid like Daniel in such a short time period. Adriana is an excellent chess coach. I highly recommend her for coaching your kids learning chess or advancing his/her chess skills.",

      "Adriana is a person of high integrity and she is very caring. Her knowledge of chess openings, middle games , strategy and end games is amazing. She helped me improve my performance in chess immensely. She helped me learn strategies, analyze my games and make decisions in difficult positions. I would recommend her for anyone looking for a professional and caring trainer. Thanks a world Adriana for all your excellent lessons.",
